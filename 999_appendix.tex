\section{Appendix}
\label{sec:appendix}

We heavily rely on Hugging Face's Transformers library \cite{wolf-etal-2020-transformers} for all experiments involving the PLMs.
We used Weights \& Biases for tracking and logging the experiments \cite{wandb}.
Finally, we used sklearn \cite{scikit-learn} for other ML-related experiments.
