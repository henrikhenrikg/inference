    \caption{Knowledge and consistency results for the majority baseline, BERT base, and the Finetuned Model. We report the LAMA score using the original patterns, the new group-score metric that combines all patterns for a relation, and the consistency results. The results are average over 25 relations that were not part of the training and evaluation data.}
