\caption{Different types of paraphrases in \resource{}. We report examples from each paraphrase type, along with the type of relation, and the number of examples from the specific transformation from a random subset of 100 pairs. Each pair can be classified into more than a single transformation (we report one for brevity), thus the sum of transformation is more than 100.}
