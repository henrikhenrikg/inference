\section{Experiments and Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

% We report results on multiple splits of the data.
First, we report the overall consistency performances, per graph, as describe in Section \ref{sec:eval}.
The results for the different models are summarized in Table \ref{tab:entailment-main}.
% That is, the overall successful prediction of the entailed pattern, divided by the overall connection. This measurement can also be seen as a weighted average, since every edge gets a score averaged by the number of base patterns that were predicted correctly.
That is, the p1,
