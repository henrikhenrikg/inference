\subsection{Knowledge Extraction Through Different Patterns}


% \subsection{Consistency and Knowledge}

% \yg{wdym by ``to asses the knowledge and ability of the different patterns to extract knowledge''? in particular, what is the first `knowledge'?}
% To better understand the results, and assess the knowledge and ability of the different patterns to extract the correct knowledge of \resource{}, we report additional metrics that help understanding the results. \sr{need a better motivation. e.g. ``In this section, we provide a finer-grained analysis, measuring consistency scores in various settings". But honestly this looks a bit like a checklist of different, unrelated experiments, and may be better pushed into an appendix.}

We begin by assessing the variability of our patterns, as well as the degree of which they extract the correct entities. These results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:extractability_results}.

First, we report the percentage of patterns that successfully predicted the right object at least once (Succ-Patt). A high score in this measure suggests that the patterns are decent, and models make use of them to extract the correct answer. As seen from the results, all PLMs achieve an almost perfect score (between 99.7\% - 100\%).
Next, we report the percentage of entities that were predicted correctly by at least one of the patterns (Succ-Objs). 
This metric quantifies the degree to which the knowledge is stored by the models.
Notably, some tuples are not predicted correctly by any of our patterns, where the scores varies between 43.8\% for albert-base and 62.2 for BERT-large
Since the average number of patterns is 8.63, i.e there are multiple ways to extract the knowledge, we interpret these results as evidence that a large part knowledge is not stored in these models. 
% \nk{This seems to suggest that it is the fault of the pattern that knowledge is not extracted from the model but an unsuccessful prediction across all models of the same tuple rather says that this knowledge is not stored} 
% The average number of factual knowledge that are correctly extracted varies between 45.3\% to 63.0\%, depending on the model. Notably, the BERT based models are consistently better than the rest in extracting the knowledge. 


% \yg{give this part a paragraph title?}
Finally, we measure the consistency results for the tuples
subset where no pattern predicted the correct answer correctly (Unk-Const) and where at least one of the patterns for a specific
relation predicted the correct answer \textsc{Know-Const}.
% A higher score on the first metric would suggest that storing the correct answer is related to the consistency of the model and performing consistent predictions across paraphrases.
Overall, the results indicate that when the factual knowledge is successfully extracted, the model is also more consistent.
For instance, the Know-Const metric for BERT-large is 62.7\% and Unk-Const is 47.8\%. 
\nk{I would emphasize this even more and say that our graph is able to distinguish pattern dependent guessing and the other is knowledge stored in the model}
% point on a connection between acquiring the correct knowledge, and the ability to extract it robustly. 
% We refer to these metrics as \textsc{Know} and \textsc{Unk}, respectively, that stands for Knowledgeable and Unknowledgeable consistency.
% The additional consistent measurement we report is Const-Objs, which measures the number of tuples that are predicted consistently across all patterns for a particular relation.
% \ye{not sure if this one is important / alternatively maybe use this one instead of the main consistency score?}


\subsection{Consistency \& Knowledge}
\input{tables/consistency_small}
In this section, we report the overall knowledge metric that was used in \citet{lama}, our consistency results, as well as a new metric that combines both knowledge and consistency metrics.
The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:consistency_results_small}.

We begin with the LAMA results, that is, the acc@1 of a model in predicting the object, using the original patterns from \citet{lama}. This metric inspects whether the first object within the candidate set of each relation is the correct answer. The reported numbers for this metric differ from \citet{lama} as we use a candidate set, as well as take only the KB triple where the objects are a single token in all models we inspect. The results range between 28.4\% with albert-base to 45.0\% with bert-large whole-word-masking, being the best model in that aspect.

Next, we report the consistency metric that was introduced in the previous section.
The BERT-based models achieve higher scores over the rest. Moreover, there is a consistent improvement from the \textit{base} to \textit{large} versions of each model.
% , although it is not always significantly \am{is there a significance test?} higher (e.g. 57.3\% to 59.1\% in BERT, and 50.1\% to 54.8\% in RoBERTa).
In contrast to many previous works that observed quantitative and qualitative improvements of RoBERTa-based models over BERT, in terms of consistency, BERT is more consistent than RoBERTa and ALBERT.
Still, the overall results are remarkably low (59.6\% for the best model, %\yg{meaning that out of XXX, YYY are ZZZ}),
especially given the permissive evaluation that only looks at the candidate set.
We note that the results are highly variant between models and relations. For instance, the best performing model on the `capital of' relation achieves 94\%, whereas the best performing model achieves on the `owned by' relation 44\%. 
On the other hand, the models' performance on the `original language of film or TV show' relation, varies between 52\% and 90\% accuracy.
% We report the full consistency results for each relation in the Appendix.

Finally, we report another metric, \textsc{Group-Score}, where a point is given only when all patterns predict the object correctly. This metric is much stricter, while combining both the requirement of a model to be consistent and factually correct. 
The results are much lower than the LAMA metric, as expected, but follow the same trend: albert-base perform worse, 15.8\% and bert-large performs best with 26.8\% accuracy.





% For brevity, we report the results solely on BERT-large, which achieved the highest results. The results can be viewed in Table \ref{tab:bert-results}.


An interesting observation from the results, is the clear superiority of the BERT models over the others, both in the factual knowledge correctness and consistency. This result, which we hypothesise to be due to the training data, may have a broader impact on models to come: Training bigger models with more data is not always beneficial. Since Wikipedia is likely a large unified source of factual knowledge that exists in unstructured data, the focused\am{I don't like the word "focused"} training on it (besides from the book corpus) was likely to make the BERT models incorporate it better.
As such, it is unclear if models such as GPT-3 \cite{gpt3}, or other future models that solely train on more data with more parameters are likely to be more consistent.
% \am{this is unsubstantiated, you can add "we hypothesize" to make this claim}% and retain more factual knowledge.

% \subsection{Consistency}

% The results for the different models are summarized in Table \ref{tab:consistency_main}.
% % First, we report the average consistency results for all graphs, as describe in Section \ref{sec:eval}.
% The last column (``Consistency'') shows the average results across all relations \yg{consider oredering the table columns in the order of their discussion}\am{I actually like it in the end, its easier to find in a glance}

% \enote{hs}{below: i would prefer ``(training) corpus size''
%   over ``number of tokens'' if that's what you mean}

\paragraph{Effect of Pretraining Corpus Size}
Next, we study the question of whether the number of tokens used during the pretraining contributes to consistency.
We use the pretrained RoBERTas model provided by \citet{robertas} and repeat the experiments on four additional models.
These models are RoBERTa-based models, that were trained on a sample of Wikipedia and the book corpus, with varying training size, and parameters. In practice, we use one of the three published models for each configuration and report the average accuracy over the relations for each model in Table \ref{tab:robertas}.
Overall, the consistency and the knowledge scores (LAMA and Group-Score) improve when trained on more data. However, there is an interesting outlier to this trend.
First, the model that was trained on one million tokens is more consistent than the models trained on ten and one-hundred million tokens. A potentially crucial difference is that this model is also smaller in terms of the number of parameters than the rest, in order to avoid overfitting. Still, it is nonetheless interesting that a model that is trained on significantly less data can achieve better consistency. On the other hand, the knowledge scores are lower, arguably due to the model being exposed to less factual knowledge during pretraining.

% Finally, the original RoBERTa that was trained on ten billion parameters, achieves the same consistency performance as the one trained on one billion tokens, suggesting a limit to the benefit of training examples in pretraining. \nk{not sure about this as the table is not there yet, but shouldn't it be: Finally, the original RoBERTa that was trained on ten billion tokens, achieves the same consistency performance as the one trained on one billion tokens, suggesting on a limit to the benefit of large training corpora. }

\subsection{Do PLMs Generalize Over Syntax?} 

\input{tables/syntax_results}

Many papers found models (especially PLMs) to naturally encode syntax \cite{linzen2016assessing,marvin-linzen-2018-targeted,yoav-syntax,hewitt2019structural}. How does this reflect in their ability to abstract knowledge and produce it while controlling for syntactic variations?
We consider two scenarios: (1) the syntax is the only component that differs between the patterns and (2) both the syntax and the lexical choice remain the same.
Success on the first scenario indicates the ability of the model to abstract the knowledge, and extract it using different syntactic patterns. Success on the second indicates the abstraction over word order and tense. This way, we can test for consistency in models, while controlling for syntactic variation.\footnote{We consider two patterns to have the same syntax if the path between the entities are equal} 
% \sr{needs a footnote on our \emph{proxy} for syntactic change.}
% staying invariant to alternations while the syntax is the only component that differs, and when 
We parse all the patterns from \resource{} using a dependency parser \cite{spacy}\footnote{\url{https://spacy.io/}} and retain the path between the subject and object.
% Then, for every pattern pair, we split into two groups: (1) patterns where the only difference is the syntactic path, but the lexical items are equal, and (2) patterns where both the syntactic path and the lexical items are identical. \nk{This sentence seems repetitive}
% we filter out all cases where the syntactic path is different. 


The results are reported in Table \ref{tab:syntax_results}.  While the results are not comparable to the main results on the entire data, as they contain different patterns, overall the results are low: 61.5\% for BERT-large when only the syntax differs, and 78.7\% when even the syntax is identical.
While PLMs have shown impressive syntactic ability, the ability to abstract syntax and make use of it to extract factual knowledge is still lacking.
% These results are surprising, since the ability to abstract over syntax is perhaps the easier abstraction, and was expected to perform better, given other results on PLMs syntactic abilities. \sr{not sure if we can say it's easier/harder.}

These results reminiscent of the findings of \citet{mccoy2019right}, which showed that models trained on an NLI dataset \cite{dagan-rte,snli} such as MNLI \cite{mnli}, are bound to use superficial syntactic heuristics, rather than more generalizable methods.
However, we demonstrate that even PLMs are susceptible to these errors.
